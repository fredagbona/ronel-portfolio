Project: Ronel Portfolio (static HTML/CSS/JS)

Purpose
- Single-page portfolio site (French content) rebuilt from a React/Tailwind version.

Key files
- index.html
- assets/style/style.css
- assets/script/script.js

Behavior
- Navbar shrinks and blurs on scroll; mobile menu locks body scroll.
- Hero text and background blobs animate with scroll-based parallax.
- TikTok embeds are lazy-loaded via IntersectionObserver or user click.

Editing guidance
- Keep styling in `assets/style/style.css`.
- Keep behavior in `assets/script/script.js`.
- Avoid introducing build tools; keep it static.
- Prefer ASCII unless the existing content requires accents.
